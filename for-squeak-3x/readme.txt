SqueakAmp readme file
=====================

Use these files if you are running version 3.x of Squeak.  A BIG THANKS to Karl Ramberg for coding up the changes to accommodate the new AlignmentMorphs.  If you are running Squeak 2.8, visit the site below to download the older version of SqueakAmp.  Because Squeak 3.x now contains the MPEG3 Plugin in the base image, you no longer have to separately download and install John McIntosh's plugin.

Please note that this version has only been tested with Squeak 3.1 alpha, build 4332.

Be sure to periodically check the SqueakAmp web site for updates - http://www.bobjectsinc.com/squeakamp

	Enjoy!
