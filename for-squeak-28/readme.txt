SqueakAmp readme file
=====================

This is SqueakAmp for Squeak version 2.8.  If you use a more recent version of Squeak, use the newer version, located at http://www.bobjectsinc.com/squeakamp

In addition to these files, you will need John McIntosh's MPEG3 Plugin support files, 
which you can find at http://www.smalltalkconsulting.com/html/mpeg3source.html .
Be sure to get his fix changesets while you're there.

Be sure to periodically check the SqueakAmp web site for updates - http://www.bobjectsinc.com/squeakamp

	Enjoy!
