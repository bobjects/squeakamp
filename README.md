### An MP3 player for Squeak Smalltalk

https://www.bobjectsinc.com/squeakamp/

This is SqueakAmp, a full-featured MP3 player that I wrote many years ago for Squeak Smalltalk.  Considering the Squeak philosophy of changing things rapidly without concern for breaking existing stuff, I'm certain that this will not work without modification in later versions of Squeak, especially the GUI stuff.

Still, some may find it interesting to file in the SqueakAmpModel changeset and take a look around.  Specifically, there's a decent Smalltalk implementation of the State pattern here.

The readme.txt files in the subdirectories are the original readme files for the project.  For more information, check out the above link.

Enjoy!
